 How to compare 2 numpy arrays online
There are no reliable online tools. 2 options. One is in python, other is in pycharm. I wanna explain about the latter. 
Load the numpy array using `np.load` and then hit the debug mode in pycharm. View the variable you loaded as array in pycharm and then export it to csv files. 
Then use any online csv compare tool to compare the arrays
